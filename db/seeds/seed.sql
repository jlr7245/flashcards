INSERT INTO flashcards(question,answer,category,difficulty) VALUES ('What''s the difference between a function expression and a function declaration?','Both function expressions and function declarations fundamentally work the same. Function expressions, however are (a) not hoisted and (b) mutable. Because function expressions are part of a larger expression syntax (e.g.: a variable assignment), it can be reassigned. Function declarations, on the other hand, do not require a variable assignment and are hoisted. Since function declarations are hoisted, this means that a function can be called before it is defined, due to the fact that JavaScript files are parsed through before they are ran.','JS Basics',1);
